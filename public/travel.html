    <h4>Barbados</h4>
    <img class="travelImg" src="assets/images/barbadosBeach.JPG" alt="barbados beach">

    <p>What brought me to Barbados was my love for beaches/oceans. 
     I have a Bajan friend who lives in Barbados, this gave me a sense of comfort knowing I wasn't completely alone.
      After I graduated collage I was having a really hard time falling under pressure to find a job and transition into 
      life after collage. Traveling always helped clear my mind and restore my energy.<strong> I deserved a trip.</strong></p>
      <img class="travelImg" src="assets/images/budgetingTravel.png" alt="Delta and Airbnb">

      <p>Let’s talk about $$$$. I live in MN which makes finding cheap flights difficult so I usually fly out of the 
          cheapest city. I flew from Miami to Barbados. I always check first if I have enough sky miles I can use up on my cards.
          This time I used my American Airlines sky miles (I do not recommend their program; Delta’s sky miles hold more value and offer better flights).
          I stayed in Barbados for 3 nights at an Airbnb in the Christ Church Perish. The area is close to many of the south coast hotels, bars,
          shopping centers, and has several very attractive beaches. I paid about $120 for the Airbnb it wasn’t anything luxurious but it was a very 
          nice house and the host was wonderful. I felt safe because the landlors and other locals always looked out for me while I was there.  I was recommended not to stay in 
          Bridgetown because it was not close to beaches, higher lodging prices, and some parts were pretty run down.
       </p>

       <h4>Things I didn’t expect</h4>
The size of the island, was very small. There is one highway going up and down.
$$$ things are not as cheap as one may expect. A typical simple sea food meal with 
a drink is about $17, they accept USD everywhere. Not a lot of Infrastructure, but 
it gives you that intimate feel of the island. It isn’t totally taken over by foreigners
Not many tourist in May, which was when I went but I also enjoyed that. Ladies, I would say to be careful, 
Bajan men are very persistent, I never felt disrespected but when you say ‘No” you must say it a couple more 
times because they’ll keep trying.

Catamaran cruise! Is always a must when you go on a beach vacation. 
The company I went with was EL TIGRE CATAMARAN <a href="https://www.eltigrecruises.com"target="_blank">(CLICK)</a> . 
It was all day trip which included food, and unlimited drinks!!! That was the best! Unlimited rum punch…say no more. 
The food was absolutley incredible, that was the most sea food I had ever eaten. For lunch they served Flying fish, Mac & cheese pie, and a salad
You can always negotiate the price for activities & excursions.

<p>I stayed two blocks from Dover beach on the south side of the island which was nice because of convenience. Dover beach has
a strip of amazing food shacks. Every morning I’d walk over to the beach, grab some food and just lounge. The beaches are very clean and
     clear. It is easy and super cheap to take the bus around Dover beach. It’s about .50 - $1.00.
    A short bus ride away was Oistins, a fishing village that has everything you need such as markets, handmade souvenirs,
     boutiques, ect. Overall it is famous for its Friday night open air Fish Fest, fried seafood and local dishes!
